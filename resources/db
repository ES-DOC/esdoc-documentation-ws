PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is	GFDL-ESM2M	1pctCO2

[1] The HadGEM2-AO project targeted two key features of performance: ENSO and northern continent land-surface temperature biases. The latter had a particularly high priority in order for the model to be able to adequately model continental vegetation. Through focussed working groups a number of mechanisms that improved the performance were identified. Some known systematic errors in HadGEM1, such as the Indian monsoon, were not targeted for attention in HadGEM2-AO. HadGEM2-AO substantially improved mean SSTs and wind stress and improved tropical SST variability compared to HadGEM1. The northern continental warm bias in HadGEM1 has been significantly reduced. The power spectrum of El Nino is made worse, but other aspects of ENSO are improved. Overall there is a noticeable improvement from HadGEM1	\N	\N

The prognostic variables are density, momentum, total energy, and tracer species. Sound waves are computed explicitly in horizontal and implicitly in vertical. The A-grid arrangement is adopted for the prognostic variables horizontally, that is, all of the prognostic variables are positioned at the centers of hexagonal cells. The Finite-Volume method is used for the spatial discretization of operators. The icosahedral grids are developed and optimized by the spring-dynamics method of Tomita et al. (2002). It supports a variable resolution mesh by stretching (Tomita 2008). The finite-volume method is used for the second-order accurate horizontal discretizations of divergence and gradient (Tomita et al. 2001). Tracers are transported by an upwind-bosed scheme using a linear reconstruction (Miura 2007). A three-stage Runge-Kutta scheme is supported, but the two-stage Runge-Kutta scheme is used usually.	\N	\N

In the ESM2M-C1_abrupt-4xco2_S1 experiment, atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286 ppmv to an instantaneous quadrupling (1144 ppm). CO2 levels were held constant at 1144 ppmv for the duration of the 300 year long experiment. For the entire 300 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.	GFDL-ESM2M	abrupt4xCO2

Ideally, an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) should (a) retain its water mass characteristics for centuries (a characteristic of isopycnic coordinates), (b) have high vertical resolution in the surface mixed layer (a characteristic of z-level coordinates) for proper representation of thermodynamical and biochemical processes, (c) maintain sufficient vertical resolution in unstratified or weakly-stratified regions of the ocean, and (d) have high vertical resolution in coastal regions (a characteristic of terrain-following coordinates).	\N	\N

PCMDI experiment name = natural-only (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 0162 of the parent experiment, ESM2M_pi-control_C1 (piControl). Only natural forcing agents (i.e., solar irradiance and volcanoes) varied during the 145 year duration of the ESM2M-C1_historical_natural_HCN1 experiment in a manner based upon observations for the late 19th and 20th centuries. Anthropogenic forcing agents (i.e., well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, aerosol concentrations (sulfate, black and organic carbon, sea salt, dust), were representative of conditions circa-1860. There was no land use in this run (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.	GFDL-ESM2M	historicalNat

Model fields are represented in terms of spherical harmonics subject to a triangular trunction. The spectral transform method enables an efficient calculation of nonlinear products [Orszag 1970 and Eliasen et. al 1970]. The model employs a semi-implicit time integration method for making the treatment fast gravity wave tendencies more efficient. The vertical coordinate is sigma (pressure divided by surface pressure) and the vertically discretized equations conserve total energy and mass.	\N	\N

The temporal discretization is a two-time-level Crank-Nicholson iterative semi-Lagrangian method with an advecting wind interpolated in time. Recently, the vertical staggering (Charney-Phillips grid) was introduced and is described by Girard et al. (2010). GEM Lat-Lon uses the latitude-longitude grid. Implicit 2D diffusion damps the winds [u,v,d(zeta)/dt,dz/dt]. A 6th order selective diffusion (Qaddouri and Lee, 2008) is adopted with a 2 Delta-x removal ratio of 4% per timestep and is applied after the physics. In GEM, the dynamics and physics are time split. All prognostic variables are updated by the dynamics and then the physics. The time step is the same for dynamics and physics.	\N	\N

It is an outgrowth of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), which was developed for investigating meso- and cloud-scale phenomena.  OLAM incorporates all of the physics schemes from RAMS, and is thus equipped for atmospheric simulations at very high resolution.  The major improvement over RAMS is its OLAM's dynamic core and computational grid that accommodates the entire globe while enabling local refinement in targeted regions of interest or significance.  Thus, OLAM combines the advantages of global models and high resolution regional models into a single fully-interactive framework.\n\nOLAM employs an unstructured mesh of either hexagonal or triangular grid cells based on refinement of an icosahedron, thus avoiding the polar singularities of the more traditional latitude-longitude grid.

The prognostic variables are wind, potential virtual temperature, moist density and water related moist air mixing ratios. The equations are discretized in the horizontal on a triangular icosahedral grid with C-grid staggering and in the vertical on a terrain following hybrid sigma-height grid using a Lorenz staggering.

The vertical\n        discretization utilizes a "Lagrangian control-volume" principle, which is based on a\n        terrain-following floating Lagrangian coordinate system and a fixed Eulerian reference\n        frame. In particular, the vertically stacked finite volumes are allowed to float for a\n        duration of several time steps before they are mapped back monotonically and conservatively\n        to the fixed reference system (Lin 2004). The advection algorithm makes use of the monotonic\n        third-order piecewise parabolic method (Colella and Woodward 1984) with an explicit\n        time-stepping scheme.

The Yin-Yang global forecast is performed by considering a domain decomposition (a two-way coupling method) between two limited-area models (LAMs) discretized on the two panels of the Yin-Yang grid and using the same time step (Qaddouri, A., and V.Lee, 2011).

Energy conservation is achieved by discretizing the antisymmetric Poisson bracket which mimics correct energy conversions between the different kinds of energy (kinetic, potential, internal). Because of the bracket structure this is even possible in a complicated numerical environment with (i) the occurrence of terrain-following coordinates with all the metric terms in it, (ii) the horizontal C-grid staggering on the Voronoi mesh and the complications induced by the need for an acceptable stationary geostrophic mode, and (iii) the necessity for avoiding Hollingsworth instability.

Maintain the same constant boundary forcing as the pre-industrial control integration, except for the volcanic forcing. Requires special diagnostics of parameterised and resolved wave forcings, radiative and latent heating rates. The experiment will not account for the actual climate conditions when the real event occured (e.g., presence and strength of additional forcing factors). Instead, the experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in the post-eruption behaviour that are related to background climate conditions. Sampling of an eastern phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), as observed after the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is preferred for those models that spontaneously generate such mode of stratospheric variability. Run at least 25 ensemble members for 3 years. Use a model configuration with a slab ocean.	\N	\N

The experiment will not account for the actual climate conditions when the real event occured (e.g., presence and strength of additional forcing factors). Instead, the experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in the post-eruption behaviour that are related to background climate conditions. Sampling of an eastern phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), as observed after the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is preferred for those models that spontaneously generate such mode of stratospheric variability.

The experiment will not account for the actual climate conditions when the real event occured (e.g., presence and strength of additional forcing factors). Instead, the experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in the post-eruption behaviour that are related to background climate conditions. Sampling of an eastern phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), as observed after the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is preferred for those models that spontaneously generate such mode of stratospheric variability.

The experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in post-eruption behaviour that are related to background climate conditions.  If, for instance, year Y of the control integration matches the desired conditions for the initial condition sampling, then the corresponding VolMIP simulation should start with restart data from year Y-1 of the control.
